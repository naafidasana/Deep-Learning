# üéØ Here‚Äôs The Elite List: 10 Best AI Projects For You

| # | Project | Domain | Why It's üî• |
|:--|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| 1 | **Pose Detection + Workout Feedback App** | CV | Train workout classification model and give real-time feedback (Fitness SaaS possible). |
| 2 | **Stock Price Prediction with LSTM / Transformer** | Time Series | Predict stock prices. Learn financial modeling and time series deep learning. |
| 3 | **Fine-tune LLM on GitHub WebDev Repos** | LLM / NLP | Create a small coding assistant (specialized in web dev). Potential for freelance or SaaS. |
| 4 | **Autonomous Car Driving (Simulation)** | DRL / CV | Train a car agent to drive inside a simulated environment (CARLA / TORCS). Super cool and real-world RL. |
| 5 | **Deep RL Trading Bot** | DRL / Finance | Use RL to trade stocks or crypto autonomously. Advanced finance + RL combined = üî• |
| 6 | **Personal Knowledge Base with LLM** | LLM / Retrieval | Create your own "Second Brain" AI that stores and retrieves knowledge (future productivity app). |
| 7 | **AI Retail Shelf Monitoring** | CV / Object Detection | Detect missing products in supermarket shelves (real-world use case, B2B SaaS potential). |
| 8 | **Human Action Recognition in Videos** | CV / DL | Classify actions like "running", "jumping", "punching" from videos (useful for security, sports analytics). |
| 9 | **Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant** | Speech + LLM | Build a voice assistant using speech recognition and LLMs (cool personal project or smart home idea). |
| 10 | **Portfolio Optimization with AI (RL or DL)** | Finance / RL | Create an AI that allocates money optimally between stocks based on risk and return. Fund managers would love this. |
